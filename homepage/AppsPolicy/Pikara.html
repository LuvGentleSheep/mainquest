        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> The only data the App processes are the images you select within the App. These images are used solely for providing the app’s features and are not transmitted, stored, or shared with any third party.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            Any images you select are processed locally on your device. We do not upload, store, or transmit your images or any other data outside of your device.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Pikara does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. No information is shared with external parties.
